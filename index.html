    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Plants are natural resources rich in beneficial bioactive compounds that play an
        important role in the development of novel drugs. Extensive research has been
        carried out worldwide to study the antioxidant, antimicrobial, wound-healing,
        anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties of medicinal plants.
    </p>

    <p>
        The metabolite profile of endophytes is strongly influenced by the unique chemical
        environment of the host plant. Among these, fungal endophytes are considered
        promising sources of biologically active compounds with significant medicinal
        importance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aloe vera is a well-known medicinal plant possessing antioxidant, anticancer,
        anti-ulcer, wound-healing, and skin-protective properties. Pharmacologically
        important compounds are mainly present in the parenchymatous tissue of the
        fleshy leaves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aloe vera (<em>Aloe barbadensis Mill.</em>) is one of the oldest medicinal plants in
        human history and is often referred to as the “healing plant” due to the presence
        of acemannan, a compound with immunomodulatory, antitumor, antibacterial, and
        antifungal properties.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite its medicinal importance, Aloe vera plants are susceptible to several
        fungal and bacterial diseases. Fungal pathogens cause leaf spot, collar rot, and
        root rot, adversely affecting plant growth, yield, and therapeutic quality.
        Since Aloe vera is widely used in medicinal and cosmetic products, fungal
        contamination poses a serious risk to human health due to the production of
        harmful mycotoxins.

    <h2>Review of Literature</h2>

    <p>
        Fuad Ameen et al. (2021) isolated and identified endophytic fungi from Aloe vera
        plants collected from desert regions of Saudi Arabia. Molecular identification
        using ITS sequencing revealed <em>Preussia africana</em> as a potential endophyte
        with significant bioactive properties.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kamalakannan et al. (2008) reported <em>Alternaria alternata</em> as the causal
        agent of leaf spot disease in Aloe vera in Tamil Nadu, India. The pathogen was
        isolated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and identified based on colony morphology,
        conidia shape, and size.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohammed Ali Abdul Razzaq Al-Nuaimy et al. (2024) isolated 53 endophytic fungi
        from Aloe vera leaves, including <em>Aspergillus terreus</em>, <em>Aspergillus niger</em>,
        <em>Penicillium chermesinum</em>, and <em>Paecilomyces variotii</em>. Chemical analysis
        revealed aloin, aloe-emodin, and various fatty acids.
    </p>

    <p>
        Divya Singh et al. (2024) identified fungal pathogens responsible for leaf spot
        disease of Aloe vera, including <em>Alternaria alternata</em>, <em>Nigrospora oryzae</em>,
        <em>Curvularia lunata</em>, <em>Aspergillus niger</em>, and <em>Penicillium</em> species.
        Among these, <em>Alternaria alternata</em> showed the highest disease severity.

    <h2>Aim and Objectives</h2>

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
        To isolate and identify fungal pathogens responsible for diseases in Aloe vera
        plants in order to understand their diversity and develop effective disease
        management strategies.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To collect healthy and infected Aloe vera plant samples showing disease symptoms.</li>
        <li>To isolate fungal pathogens from infected plant tissues.</li>
        <li>To identify fungal isolates based on morphological and cultural characteristics.</li>
        <li>To study the pathogenicity of isolated fungi on healthy Aloe vera plants.</li>
        <li>To document the diversity and prevalence of fungal pathogens affecting Aloe vera.</li>

    <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Infected Aloe vera plant samples</li>
        <li>Laboratory equipment: Autoclave, incubator, microscope</li>
        <li>Culture media: Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)</li>
        <li>Chemicals: 70% ethanol, sodium hypochlorite, sterile distilled water</li>
        <li>Consumables: Petri plates, inoculation needles, slides, gloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>
        Infected Aloe vera leaves were washed and surface sterilized using ethanol and
        sodium hypochlorite. Small tissue segments were inoculated on PDA plates and
        incubated at 25–28°C for 5–7 days.
    </p>

    <p>
        Emerging fungal colonies were sub-cultured to obtain pure isolates.
        Morphological identification was performed by observing colony characteristics
        and microscopic features.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pathogenicity tests were conducted by inoculating healthy Aloe vera plants and
        re-isolating the pathogen to confirm disease causation.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="summary">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Fungal pathogens associated with Aloe vera were isolated and identified using
        standard microbiological techniques. Common pathogens included
        <em>Alternaria alternata</em>, <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em>, <em>Nigrospora oryzae</em>,
        <em>Curvularia lunata</em>, <em>Aspergillus niger</em>, and <em>Penicillium</em> species.
        Pathogenicity tests confirmed their disease-causing ability.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera is an important medicinal plant with high commercial value.
        Fungal diseases significantly reduce plant quality and yield. Chemical
        fungicides pose environmental and health risks; therefore, eco-friendly
        disease management strategies such as biocontrol agents and plant-based
        extracts are recommended for sustainable cultivation of Aloe vera.
