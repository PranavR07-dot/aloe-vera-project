    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This research focuses on the systematic <strong>isolation and identification</strong>
        of fungal pathogens affecting <em>Aloe vera</em> (<em>Aloe barbadensis Mill.</em>).
        As one of the most vital medicinal plants globally, degradation of Aloe vera by
        fungal agents significantly impacts its pharmacological efficacy and market value.
        This project bridges the gap between pathogen detection and eco-friendly control measures.

    <h2>1. Botanical & Phytochemical Profile</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Aloe vera</em> is a perennial herb characterized by fleshy leaves containing a
        high concentration of mucilaginous gel. The name originates from the Arabic
        <em>“Alloeh”</em> (shining bitter substance) and the Latin <em>“vera”</em> (true).
    </p>

    <h3>Bioactive Constituents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acemannan:</strong> A major polysaccharide responsible for immunomodulatory and antitumor activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Aloin & Aloe-emodin:</strong> Important anthraquinones with antimicrobial and laxative properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Fatty Acids:</strong> Includes linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids.</li>
        <li><strong>Parenchymatous Tissue:</strong> The primary storage site of pharmacologically active compounds.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="pathology">
    <h2>2. Clinical Pathology of Aloe vera</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera is susceptible to a wide range of fungal diseases, especially under
        conditions of improper cultivation and high humidity.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Disease Symptoms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaf Spots:</strong> Circular or irregular necrotic lesions with dark sporulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip Dieback:</strong> Progressive drying of leaves resulting in loss of medicinal gel.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotting:</strong> Collar and root rot severely affecting plant growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Mycotoxin Risk:</strong> Presence of toxic fungal metabolites harmful to human health.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Academic Review of Literature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Kamalakannan et al. (2008):</strong>
            Identified <em>Alternaria alternata</em> as the causal agent of leaf spot disease in India.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Al-Nuaimy et al. (2024):</strong>
            Isolated 53 endophytic fungi including <em>Aspergillus terreus</em> and
            <em>Aspergillus niger</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Divya Singh et al. (2024):</strong>
            Reported highest disease severity caused by <em>Alternaria alternata</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fuad Ameen et al. (2021):</strong>
            Isolated <em>Preussia africana</em> from desert-grown Aloe vera.
        </li>

<section id="methodology">
    <h2>4. Advanced Research Methodology</h2>

    <h3>Sample Processing</h3>
    <p>
        Infected tissues were washed and surface-sterilized using 70% ethanol followed
        by sodium hypochlorite to remove epiphytic contaminants.
    </p>

    <h3>Cultural Conditions</h3>
    <p>
        Tissue segments were inoculated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated at
        25–28°C for 5–7 days. Pure cultures were obtained by repeated sub-culturing.
    </p>

    <h3>Morphological Identification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microscopy:</strong> Observation of spore shape, size, and arrangement.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxonomy:</strong> Identification based on colony morphology and conidial structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Colonization Rate:</strong> Calculated from fungal isolates per leaf segment.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="management">
    <h2>5. Integrated Disease Management (IDM)</h2>
    <p>
        Effective disease management is essential to preserve the medicinal and commercial
        value of Aloe vera.
    </p>

    <h3>Eco-friendly Alternatives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biocontrol Agents:</strong> Use of beneficial microorganisms to suppress pathogens.</li>
        <li><strong>Plant Extracts:</strong> Botanical antifungal compounds as safe alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Approach:</strong> Combination of biological and cultural practices.</li>
    </ul>
