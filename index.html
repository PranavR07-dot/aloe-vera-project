    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This study focuses on the isolation and identification of fungal pathogens
        associated with Aloe vera (<em>Aloe barbadensis Mill.</em>), a medicinal plant
        of global significance. Fungal diseases significantly reduce plant yield,
        therapeutic quality, and commercial value.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project integrates classical microbiological techniques with sustainable
        disease management strategies to ensure eco-friendly Aloe vera cultivation.
    </p>

<section id="importance">
    <h2>Medicinal and Economic Importance of Aloe vera</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera gel is widely used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food supplements,
        and traditional medicine. It contains compounds such as acemannan, aloin,
        aloe-emodin, vitamins, enzymes, and essential fatty acids.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fungal infections not only affect plant growth but also increase the risk
        of mycotoxin contamination, making infected plants unsafe for human use.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="botany">
    <h2>Botanical and Phytochemical Profile</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera is a perennial succulent plant belonging to the family Liliaceae.
        The fleshy leaves store mucilaginous gel rich in pharmacologically active compounds.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acemannan:</strong> Immunomodulatory polysaccharide</li>
        <li><strong>Aloin & Aloe-emodin:</strong> Antimicrobial anthraquinones</li>
        <li><strong>Fatty Acids:</strong> Oleic, linoleic, palmitic, stearic acids</li>
        <li><strong>Parenchymatous Tissue:</strong> Storage site of bioactive compounds</li>
    </ul>

<section id="pathology">
    <h2>Clinical Pathology of Aloe vera</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera plants are highly susceptible to fungal diseases, particularly
        under conditions of high humidity, poor drainage, and improper cultivation.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Necrotic lesions with dark sporulation</li>
        <li><strong>Tip Dieback:</strong> Progressive drying of leaf tips</li>
        <li><strong>Collar & Root Rot:</strong> Affects plant stability and growth</li>
        <li><strong>Mycotoxin Risk:</strong> Toxic metabolites harmful to humans</li>
    </ul>

<section id="pathogens">
    <h2>Major Fungal Pathogens Identified</h2>
    <p>
        The following fungal pathogens were frequently isolated from infected Aloe vera samples:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>Alternaria alternata</em></li>
        <li><em>Fusarium oxysporum</em></li>
        <li><em>Curvularia lunata</em></li>
        <li><em>Nigrospora oryzae</em></li>
        <li><em>Aspergillus niger</em></li>
        <li><em>Penicillium</em> species</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="methodology">
    <h2>Research Methodology</h2>

    <h3>Sample Collection & Sterilization</h3>
    <p>
        Infected Aloe vera leaves were collected, washed thoroughly, and surface
        sterilized using 70% ethanol followed by sodium hypochlorite.
    </p>

    <h3>Isolation & Culturing</h3>
    <p>
        Sterilized tissue segments were inoculated onto Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)
        and incubated at 25–28°C for 5–7 days. Distinct fungal colonies were sub-cultured
        to obtain pure isolates.
    </p>

    <h3>Identification</h3>
    <p>
        Fungal isolates were identified based on colony morphology and microscopic
        characteristics such as spore shape, size, and arrangement.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="management">
    <h2>Integrated Disease Management Strategies</h2>
    <p>
        Excessive use of chemical fungicides leads to environmental pollution and
        pathogen resistance. Hence, sustainable disease management strategies are essential.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biocontrol Agents:</strong> Beneficial fungi and bacteria</li>
        <li><strong>Plant Extracts:</strong> Natural antifungal compounds</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Approach:</strong> Cultural + biological methods</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="future">
    <h2>Future Scope of the Study</h2>
    <p>
        Future research can focus on molecular identification of fungal pathogens,
        development of biofungicides, and AI-based disease detection systems using
        image processing techniques.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera is a valuable medicinal plant, but fungal diseases significantly
        threaten its quality and yield. Early detection, proper cultivation practices,
        and eco-friendly disease management strategies are crucial for sustainable
        Aloe vera production.
