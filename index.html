    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Medicinal plants have been an integral part of traditional and modern medicine
        due to their rich reservoir of bioactive compounds that contribute to the
        development of novel therapeutic drugs. Consequently, extensive research has
        been conducted worldwide to evaluate the antioxidant, antimicrobial,
        wound-healing, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties of
        medicinal plants.
    </p>

    <p>
        The metabolite profiles of endophytes are significantly influenced by the
        unique chemical environment of their host plants. Among these, fungal
        endophytes have gained considerable attention as promising sources of
        biologically active compounds with immense medicinal potential.
        These microorganisms establish symbiotic relationships within plant tissues
        and thrive in highly competitive ecological environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Aloe vera</em> is a well-known medicinal plant possessing antioxidant,
        anticancer, anti-ulcer, wound-healing, and skin-protective properties.
        Pharmacologically important compounds are primarily concentrated in the
        parenchymatous tissue of the fleshy leaves. The plant is often collected
        from highly stressed environments, which further influences the diversity
        and activity of associated endophytic microorganisms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Endophytes, including fungi and bacteria, reside within various tissues of
        host plants without causing apparent disease symptoms. In Aloe vera,
        these endophytes play a crucial role in enhancing the plant’s defense
        mechanisms and contribute to the production of valuable secondary metabolites.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Aloe barbadensis</em> (syn. <em>Aloe vera</em>), commonly known as Indian Aloe
        or Barbados Aloe, is a perennial herb characterized by thick, fleshy leaves
        with high medicinal value. The name <em>Aloe</em> is derived from the Arabic
        word “Alloeh,” meaning “shining bitter substance,” while “vera” in Latin
        signifies “true.” More than 325 species of the genus <em>Aloe</em> have been
        identified, including <em>A. saponaria</em>, <em>A. chinensis</em>,
        <em>A. variegata</em>, <em>A. ferox</em>, <em>A. latifolia</em>, and
        <em>A. curacao</em>. Among these, <em>Aloe barbadensis</em> is the most widely
        cultivated species due to its rapid propagation and superior therapeutic
        properties, and is therefore referred to as the “True Aloe.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Aloe vera is often described as the “healing plant” owing to the presence of
        acemannan, a bioactive polysaccharide with immunomodulatory, antitumor,
        antibacterial, and antifungal properties. The plant has been traditionally
        used for treating digestive disorders such as constipation, poor appetite,
        colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and diabetes. Externally, Aloe vera is
        widely applied in the treatment of sunburn, wounds, psoriasis, eczema,
        ulcers, acne, and dermatitis due to its ability to stimulate cell regeneration.
        Additionally, the plant exhibits cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant
        effects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like other cultivated plants, Aloe vera is susceptible to a variety of
        fungal and bacterial pathogens. However, fungal pathogens are more commonly
        associated with Aloe vera under both natural and artificial cultivation
        conditions. These pathogens cause diseases such as leaf spot, collar rot,
        and root rot, which significantly affect plant growth, development, and
        therapeutic potential.
    </p>

    <p>
        The occurrence of these diseases is often linked to a lack of scientific
        cultivation practices and favorable abiotic conditions that promote pathogen
        proliferation. Since Aloe vera is extensively used in medicinal and cosmetic
        preparations, fungal contamination poses a serious risk to human health.
        Certain fungal pathogens are capable of producing mycotoxins within infected
        plant tissues and substrates, which are harmful to both human and animal health.

    <h2>Review of Literature</h2>

    <p>
        Endophytic microorganisms isolated from desert plants are among the least explored
        biological resources, yet they possess enormous potential for valuable medicinal
        and industrial applications. Plants growing under extreme environmental stress
        often harbor unique endophytic fungi capable of producing novel bioactive
        compounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fuad Ameen et al. (2021) investigated the bioactivity of an endophytic fungus
        isolated from Aloe vera plants collected from the central regions of the Asir
        desert, Saudi Arabia. Based on preliminary phytochemical screening, an efficient
        fungal isolate was selected for molecular identification. Sequence analysis of
        the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, ITS4) and 5.8S rRNA region identified the
        fungus as <em>Preussia africana</em>, belonging to the family Sporormiaceae.
        This study highlighted the potential of desert-adapted endophytes as sources
        of biologically active compounds with pharmaceutical relevance.
    </p>

    <p>
        A review of available literature on Aloe vera diseases revealed that limited
        research has been conducted on fungal pathogens affecting Aloe vera in India.
        Kamalakannan et al. (2008) reported what appears to be the first record of
        <em>Fusarium solani</em> causing leaf spot disease in Aloe barbadensis.
        Severe disease incidence was observed in the Erode and Madurai districts of
        Tamil Nadu, India, resulting in heavy crop losses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Infected Aloe vera leaves exhibited characteristic leaf spots with black
        sporulation at the center. At later stages of infection, the affected leaves
        dried from the tip downwards and lost their mucilaginous gel, significantly
        reducing their medicinal value. The causal organism was successfully isolated
        on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) from diseased leaf tissues.
    </p>

    <p>
        A total of sixteen infected leaf samples were collected and incubated at
        25 ± 2°C under a 12-hour photoperiod. The fungus produced grey colonies with
        olive-green margins after four to five days of incubation. Microscopic
        examination revealed branched, straight, golden-brown conidiophores measuring
        approximately 15 µm in length and 2–6 µm in thickness. The conidia were golden
        brown, obclavate in shape, produced in long branched chains, and possessed a
        short conical beak. Conidial dimensions ranged from 22.75 to 63.70 µm in length
        and 13.65 to 18.20 µm in width, with an average beak length of 7.73 µm.
        The pathogen was consistently reisolated from infected tissues, fulfilling
        Koch’s postulates.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohammed Ali Abdul Razzaq Al-Nuaimy et al. (2024) conducted a comprehensive study
        on the isolation and identification of endophytic fungi from Aloe vera leaves.
        The objectives included morphological and molecular characterization of fungal
        isolates and identification of chemical constituents in leaf extracts using
        HPLC, GC, and GC-MS techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        A total of 53 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from 120 leaf segments,
        resulting in an overall colonization rate of 44.16%. Among the isolates,
        <em>Aspergillus terreus</em> exhibited the highest colonization rate (14.16%),
        followed by <em>Aspergillus niger</em> (13.33%), <em>Penicillium chermesinum</em>
        (6.66%), <em>Paecilomyces variotii</em> (2.5%), <em>Talaromyces radicus</em>,
        and <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> (1.66%). Other fungi such as
        <em>Aspergillus quadrilineatus</em>, <em>Talaromyces verruculosus</em>,
        <em>Neoscytalidium dimidiatum</em>, <em>Alternaria solani</em>, and
        <em>Aspergillus niveus</em> showed lower colonization frequencies (0.83%).
    </p>

    <p>
        Chemical analysis of Aloe vera leaf extracts using HPLC revealed the presence
        of aloin at a concentration of 125.39 ppm and aloe-emodin at 66.59 ppm.
        GC-MS analysis detected various bioactive compounds including fatty acids
        such as linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids, along with several other
        biologically active chemical constituents. These findings confirmed the
        therapeutic significance of Aloe vera and its associated endophytes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Divya Singh et al. (2024) studied the fungal pathogens associated with Aloe vera
        leaf spot disease, a major factor reducing both the quantity and quality of
        mucilaginous gel used for medicinal and commercial purposes. Infected Aloe vera
        leaves showing disease symptoms were aseptically collected and processed for
        pathogen isolation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Five fungal species were isolated and identified based on morphological and
        cultural characteristics on PDA medium. These included
        <em>Alternaria alternata</em>, <em>Nigrospora oryzae</em>,
        <em>Curvularia lunata</em>, <em>Aspergillus niger</em>, and
        <em>Penicillium</em> species. Among these, <em>Alternaria alternata</em> and
        <em>Penicillium</em> species exhibited the highest isolation frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pathogenicity tests conducted according to Koch’s postulates confirmed that
        <em>Alternaria alternata</em>, <em>Nigrospora oryzae</em>, and
        <em>Curvularia lunata</em> were pathogenic to Aloe vera leaves. Maximum disease
        severity was recorded for <em>Alternaria alternata</em> (49.05%), followed by
        <em>Nigrospora oryzae</em> (26.62%) and <em>Curvularia lunata</em> (18%),
        indicating the dominant role of these fungi in Aloe vera leaf spot disease.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, the literature indicates that fungal pathogens and endophytic fungi
        significantly influence the health, quality, and medicinal value of Aloe vera.
        However, region-specific studies remain limited, particularly in India,
        emphasizing the need for further systematic research on fungal diversity and
        disease management in Aloe vera cultivation.
