<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section id="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Medicinal plants are valuable natural resources rich in bioactive compounds that
        play a vital role in the development of novel drugs. Due to this, extensive
        research has been carried out worldwide to study the antioxidant, antimicrobial,
        wound-healing, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties of plants.
    </p>

    <p>
        The metabolite profile of endophytes is strongly influenced by the unique chemical
        environment of the host plant. Among endophytes, fungal endophytes are considered
        promising sources of biologically active compounds with significant medicinal
        importance.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Aloe vera</em> is a well-known medicinal plant possessing antioxidant,
        anticancer, anti-ulcer, wound-healing, and skin-protective properties.
        Pharmacologically important compounds are mainly present in the parenchymatous
        tissue of the fleshy leaves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Endophytes are microorganisms, including fungi and bacteria, that reside within
        plant tissues and form a symbiotic relationship with their host in highly
        competitive environments. Aloe vera is one of the oldest medicinal plants and is
        known as the “healing plant” due to the presence of acemannan, which exhibits
        immunomodulatory, antitumor, antibacterial, and antifungal activities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aloe barbadensis (syn. Aloe vera), commonly known as Indian Aloe or Barbados Aloe,
        is a perennial herb with fleshy leaves of high medicinal value. The name Aloe is
        derived from the Arabic word “Alloeh” meaning “shining bitter substance,” while
        “vera” in Latin means “true.” Among more than 325 species of Aloe, Aloe
        barbadensis is the most widely cultivated due to its rapid propagation and high
        therapeutic value.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aloe vera plants are susceptible to several fungal and bacterial diseases.
        Fungal pathogens are more commonly associated with Aloe vera and cause diseases
        such as leaf spot, collar rot, and root rot, which adversely affect plant growth,
        development, and medicinal quality. Some fungal pathogens produce mycotoxins that
        pose serious risks to human and animal health.

<!-- LITERATURE SURVEY -->
<section id="literature">
    <h2>Review of Literature</h2>

    <p>
        Endophytic fungi isolated from desert plants are among the least explored
        organisms with significant medicinal potential. Fuad Ameen et al. (2021)
        isolated an endophytic fungus from Aloe vera collected from the Asir desert,
        Saudi Arabia, and identified it as <em>Preussia africana</em> using ITS
        sequencing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kamalakannan et al. (2008) reported the first occurrence of leaf spot disease
        caused by <em>Alternaria alternata</em> on Aloe barbadensis in India. Severe
        disease incidence was observed in Erode and Madurai districts of Tamil Nadu.
        The pathogen produced grey colonies with olive green margins on PDA, and
        characteristic obclavate conidia.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mohammed Ali Abdul Razzaq Al-Nuaimy et al. (2024) isolated 53 endophytic fungi
        from Aloe vera leaves and reported a colonization rate of 44.16%. Chemical
        analysis using HPLC and GC-MS revealed aloin, aloe-emodin, fatty acids, and
        several bioactive compounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Divya Singh et al. (2024) isolated fungal pathogens responsible for Aloe vera
        leaf spot disease and identified <em>Alternaria alternata</em>,
        <em>Nigrospora oryzae</em>, and <em>Curvularia lunata</em> as major pathogenic
        species. Maximum disease severity was observed for <em>Alternaria alternata</em>.

<!-- AIM & OBJECTIVES -->
<section id="aim">
    <h2>Aim and Objectives</h2>

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
        To isolate and identify fungal pathogens responsible for diseases in Aloe vera
        plants in order to understand their diversity and develop effective disease
        management strategies.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To collect healthy and infected Aloe vera plant samples.</li>
        <li>To isolate fungal pathogens using microbiological techniques.</li>
        <li>To identify fungal isolates based on morphological characteristics.</li>
        <li>To study pathogenicity on healthy Aloe vera plants.</li>
        <li>To document diversity and prevalence of fungal pathogens.</li>

    <p>
        Plant samples were surface sterilized, cut into small segments, and inoculated
        on PDA plates. Plates were incubated at 25–28°C for 5–7 days. Fungal colonies
        were subcultured to obtain pure isolates. Identification was based on colony
        morphology and microscopic examination. Pathogenicity was confirmed using
        Koch’s postulates.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Aloe vera is an important medicinal plant with high demand in Indian and
        international markets. Fungal diseases such as black spot significantly reduce
        quality, yield, and market value. Chemical fungicides, although effective,
        pose environmental and health risks. Therefore, eco-friendly disease management
        strategies involving biocontrol agents and plant extracts are recommended for
        sustainable Aloe vera cultivation.
