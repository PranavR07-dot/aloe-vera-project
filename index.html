    <h2>Molecular Perspective of Fungal Identification</h2>
    <p>
        While the present study primarily focuses on morphological identification,
        modern mycology increasingly relies on molecular techniques for precise
        identification of fungal pathogens.
    </p>
    <p>
        DNA-based methods such as Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region sequencing
        provide accurate differentiation between closely related fungal species that
        are otherwise difficult to distinguish morphologically.
    </p>

    <section id="endophytes">
    <h2>Role of Endophytic Fungi in Aloe vera</h2>
    <p>
        Endophytic fungi reside within plant tissues without causing visible symptoms.
        In Aloe vera, these fungi play a dual role by contributing to plant defense
        mechanisms and producing bioactive metabolites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several endophytes isolated from Aloe vera have been reported to possess
        antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, highlighting their
        potential in pharmaceutical research.

    <section id="climate">
    <h2>Impact of Climate Change on Fungal Diseases of Aloe vera</h2>
    <p>
        Climate change has emerged as a critical factor influencing the epidemiology
        of plant diseases. Increased temperature, erratic rainfall, and prolonged
        humidity create favorable conditions for fungal pathogen proliferation.
    </p>
    <p>
        These changes may lead to the emergence of new pathogenic strains and
        increased disease severity in Aloe vera cultivation systems.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section id="comparison">
    <h2>Comparative Analysis of Disease Control Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional disease management relies heavily on chemical fungicides, which
        provide quick control but pose environmental and health risks.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chemical Control:</strong> Effective but leads to resistance,
            residue accumulation, and ecological imbalance.</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Control:</strong> Environmentally safe, sustainable,
            and compatible with organic farming practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Integrated Disease Management (IDM) combines the advantages of both methods
        while minimizing their limitations.
